# ATmega324PA Temperature Monitoring System Using ADC and UART
Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a temperature monitoring system using an ATmega324PA microcontroller, LM35 temperature sensor, UART communication, and a 16x2 LCD display. The system reads the analog temperature data via ADC, processes it into a Celsius value, and displays the result both on an LCD and a PC terminal via UART. The architecture ensures real-time updates using interrupts and double buffering for efficient data handling.
