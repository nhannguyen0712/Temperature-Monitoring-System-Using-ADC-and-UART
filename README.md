# Temperature-Monitoring-System-Using-ADC-and-UART
A real-time system using an LM35 sensor, ADC, and UART on ATmega324PA. It reads temperature, converts it via ADC, displays it on a 16x2 LCD, and sends data to a PC terminal via UART. Uses interrupts and double buffering for smooth, efficient operation. Simulated in Proteus.
